## Ready to make a change?

Fork the repo.

### Fork using GitHub Desktop

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

### Fork using the command line

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

### Fork with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

- [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

## Make your update

Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update.

- Are you making changes to the schema files?
  Make sure to add some tests demonstrating the use cases or solved issues.
  Don't forget to bump the version in `package.json` if you've made any schema changes.
  Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).
- Are you contributing to the documentation?
  We use [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org).

## Open a pull request

## Issue labels

- The [`good first issue` label](https://github.com/256-recipes/yuml/labels/good%20first%20issue) is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.
